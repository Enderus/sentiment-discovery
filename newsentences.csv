Harriott went out, carefully, through the iron gate into the field.

Yesterday he had asked her to marry him and she had consented.
His ship was to sail the next day.
They stood, pressed close together, under the elder tree.
Across the yellow fields of charlock they heard the village clock strike seven.
Up in the house a gong clanged.
It lasted five minutes, and five more.
There was something wrong with the engines of his ship, the Alexandra.
Three weeks later she went down in the Mediterranean, and George with her.
Harriott said she didn't care how soon she died now.
She was quite sure it would be soon, because she couldn't live without him.
He had asked her to wait for him there.
It was the place he always chose to read his poems aloud in.
And she knew what she would answer.
It was not as though Stephen were taking George's place.
She loved Stephen with her soul, in an unearthly way.
She felt that her moment was coming; it had come.
She had known just now, the moment before he told her.
She had lived there ever since her father's death two years before.
She kept on looking at the clock to see if it was four, the hour that Oscar Wade had appointed.
She was not sure that he would come, after she had sent him away yesterday.
She had shown him plainly what she meant.
We must never see each other again. And he had gone then, ashamed and beaten.
She could see him, squaring his broad shoulders to meet the blow.
She told herself she had been unnecessarily hard.
Why shouldn't they see each other again?
Until yesterday the line had never been very clearly drawn.
Today she meant to ask him to forget what he had said to her.
Once it was forgotten, they could go on being friends as if nothing had happened.
His small, flat eyes shone, reddish-brown, eager and animal.
Physically, he was very far from her admired ideal.
There was an embarrassed silence, broken by Oscar Wade.
She could give no reason to herself for going. He took her to a restaurant in Soho.
He had none of the mean virtues.
His flushed, embarrassed silence told her what he was thinking.
But when he had seen her home he left her at her garden gate.
She was not sure whether she were glad or sorry.
But there was no joy in the weeks that followed it.
Though he had no resemblance to her ideal, she couldn't live without him.
All shimmering in a thick air that the red light stained as wine stains water.
His heavy eyelids would lift; she would find his eyes fixed on hers, wondering, considering.
She knew now what the end would be.
Since George died no man had loved her, no other man ever would.
And she was sorry for him when she thought of him going from her, beaten and ashamed.
She was certain, before he was, of the end.
Only she didn't know when and where and how it would come.
It came at the close of one of their evenings when they had dined in a private sitting-room.
He said he couldn't stand the heat and noise of the public restaurant.
She went before him, up a steep, red-carpeted stair to a white door on the second landing.
From time to time they repeated the furtive, hidden adventure.
But that was dangerous, not to be risked too often.
There was something about Oscar that repelled her.
She looked another way and pretended it wasn't there.
She had left off thinking of Oscar as a man with a wife and children and a home.
His mother-in-law was coming to stay with Muriel in October and he would get away.
He would go to Paris, and Harriott should come to him there.
He could say he went on business since he had dealings in Paris.
He engaged rooms in an hotel in the rue de Rivoli.
For three days Oscar was madly in love with Harriott and Harriott with him.
As she lay awake she would turn on the light and look at him as he slept at her side.
In six days the reaction had set in.
Mercifully Oscar explained her state as fatigue following excitement.
She was in love with Oscar, and Oscar bored her.
Oscar was in love with her, and she bored him.
Her passion returned for a little while after they got back to London.
Then, gradually, the sense of danger began to wake in them.
They lived in perpetual fear, face to face with all the chances of discovery.
Oscar still swore that if he had been free he would have married her.
He pointed out that his intentions at any rate were regular.
But she asked herself: Would I marry him?
Marriage would be the Hotel Saint Pierre all over again, without any possibility of escape.
But, if she wouldn't marry him, was she in love with him?
Perhaps it was a good thing he wasn't free.
Then she told herself that these doubts were morbid, and that the question wouldn't arise.
One evening Oscar called to see her.
Muriel got well again; but their danger had enlightened them.
It came from Oscar, one evening when he sat with her in her drawing-room.
I should have thought you'd have stuck to it now you've made it what you wanted.
You were a hypocrite, Harriott, and I wasn't.
We got tired of each other and it's over.
His death was an immense relief to Harriott.
Perfect security had been impossible as long as he was alive.
But now there wasn't a living soul who knew her secret.
She forgot how little she had wanted him to be near her, alive.
It was incredible that she had ever known such a person as Oscar Wade.
And she had moments of calm happiness when his study door closed on their communion.
All these moments were saturated with a solemn holiness.
And they were insignificant compared with the moment of her dying.
She lay dozing in her white bed under the blue sky.
She was dying, and her dying made her supremely important to Clement Fanner.
He rose and lit the two candles on the altar.
He took down the crucifix from the wall and stood it against the foot-rail of the bed.
That was not what she had wanted.
I suppose you get used to it.
She wondered if she should confess to him about Oscar Wade?
One moment she thought it was possible; the next she knew that she couldn't.
For twenty years he had not been part of her life.
She had been guilty of other sins.
I have failed in charity to my poor girls.
Because of my intense repugnance to their sin.
And she lay still a long time, with her eyes shut.
She lingered for some hours in the room where these things had happened.
Its aspect was familiar and yet unfamiliar, and slightly repugnant to her.
Her own living body was that of a young woman of about thirty-two.
The bed and the sheeted body slid away somewhere out of sight.
She was standing by the door that still remained in position.
Her mind came together with a palpable click of recognition.
She could hear the droning of the organ.
She opened the door and slipped in.
She knew what she had come there for.
She knelt down and covered her face with her hands.
He passed before her, close, close outside the bench where she knelt.
There was something he had to say.
She stood up and went towards him.
He didn't move to make way for her.
He stood still, horribly still, and close, barring her passage.
She drew back; his heaving shoulders followed her.
He leaned forward, covering her with his eyes.
She opened her mouth to scream and no sound came.
She was afraid to move lest he should move with her.
The heaving of his shoulders terrified her.
One by one the lights in the side aisles were going out.
The lights in the middle aisle would go next.
If she didn't get away she would be shut up with him there, in the appalling darkness.
When she looked back, Oscar Wade was not there.
Then she remembered that Oscar Wade was dead.
Therefore, what she had seen was not Oscar; it was his ghost.
He was dead; dead seventeen years ago.
She was safe from him forever.
When she came out on to the steps of the church she saw that the road it stood in had changed.
It was not the road she remembered.
The pavement on this side was raised slightly and covered in.
It ran under a succession of arches.
She was going along the arcades of the rue de Rivoli.
Ahead of her she could see the edge of an immense grey pillar jutting out.
That was the porch of the Hotel Saint Pierre.
It was there that the horror of the place came on her.
She remembered she had to go to the left, the left.
If she went the other way she would escape it.
She was driven back past the stairhead to the left.
This third corridor was dark and secret and depraved.
She knew the soiled walls and the warped door at the end.
There was a sharp-pointed streak of light at the top.
She could see the number on it now.
If she went in it would happen again.
Oscar Wade was in the room waiting for her behind the closed door.
She felt him moving about in there.
She leaned forward, her ear to the key hole, and listened.
She could hear the measured, deliberate, thoughtful footsteps.
They were coming from the bed to the door.
The revolving doors caught her and pushed her out into the street.
The strange quality of her state was this, that it had no time.
The road dropped to the green valley.
It mounted the humped bridge over the river.
The tall iron gate stood in front of it between the ball-topped stone pillars.
And now she was in a large, low-ceilinged room with drawn blinds.
She was standing before the wide double bed.
She lifted the sheet and folded it back across the breast of the dead man.
She stared at it, fascinated, in a cold, pitiless joy.
Suddenly she broke away, turned and ran, out of the room, out of the house.
To the left the road went through the village.
If she could get further back she would be safe, out of Oscar's reach.
Standing by her father's death-bed she had been young, but not young enough.
The glass doors swung open and she passed into the restaurant.
It dropped; and she saw Oscar Wade's face.
At last they got up and faced each other.
The steep, red-carpeted staircase rose up before her.
She swerved from it, but he turned her back.
At the top of the flight she found the white door of the room she knew.
When she passed through the south gate her memory became suddenly young and clean.
The freshness of her youth was upon her.
But the man who stood before her between the pillars of the pavilion was Oscar Wade.
The smell of the elder flowers came to her over the field.
They were walking side by side down the rue de Rivoli towards the hotel.
They were sitting together now on the edge of the dingy white bed.
Their arms hung by their sides, heavy and limp, their heads drooped, averted.
Their passion weighed on them with the unbearable, unescapable boredom of immortality.
We shall have no need to look for each other.
The darkness came down swamping, it blotted out the room.
They were taller than she was, their flowers swayed and nodded above her head.
She tugged at the tall stems and had no strength to break them.
She said to herself then that she was safe.
The walk led her out through a hedge on to a bright green lawn.
She would be safe when she saw the gold-fish swimming towards her.
She knew what she would find there; her mother was in the orchard.
She had gotten back to the farthest memory of all; there was nothing beyond it.
There would be an iron gate in the wall of the orchard.
Something was different here, something that frightened her.
An ash-grey door instead of an iron gate.
Now was the time, she thought, when she might expect a little indulgence.
Do you suppose that Donald would give his feelings as an explanation?
It was a brass block, surmounted by a white Buddha painted and gilt.
For this reason it was known in the family ironically as the Token.
She had taken up the Token, and was cleaning it to give herself a pretext.
It began by Donald shouting at her.
Her hands had begun to tremble when he shouted.
She was giving one last rub as he rose, threatening.
Indeed, she dropped it at his feet.
Her large tear-glassed eyes glanced at him, frightened.
I can't even sit on his manuscripts and keep them down.
Honestly, Helen, I'd rather die than hurt anything he really cared for.
She died because she had never really known.
Words hurt him, to speak or to hear them.
He attacked it with a fury that had more hate in it than love.
And all her things, everything that could remind him of her, had been put away.
You couldn't tell what he felt or didn't feel.
The crazy thing was that I was neither frightened nor surprised.
And so I was neither surprised nor frightened now, the first evening that I saw her.
It was in the early autumn twilight, about six o'clock.
The phantasm was perfect and vivid, as if it had been flesh and blood.
His chin was sunk a little, the pipe drooping from the corner of his mouth.
He was heavy, absorbed in his smoking.
It was clear that he did not see what I saw.
And you can stay as long as you like now.
I would look up and find the phantasm there, sitting in her chair.
And it would disappear suddenly when Donald left the room.
It was as uncertain of him now as she had been in her lifetime.
I think I must have guessed even then what it had come for.
He did at least respect my love for her.
I could feel him stiffen under it.
And now, as always, my clumsy interference had only made him more hard.
But the third evening we were hardly seated before I saw it.
He was not looking at the place where it was.
He was looking hard at me, in anxiety and a sort of fright.
I saw it pull and shake it, and stand back again, baffled.
I'm not so ill that I don't know what you put it away for, I said.
There must be something very badly wrong with you, Helen, he said.
He drew back, staring at it with a look of concentrated hate and loathing.
The Buddha fell, broken to bits, among the ashes.
Rodney's own nerves were not as strong as they had been, after ten years of Bella's.
It was not to be desired that she should know.
There was no need to prepare her.
She had set herself apart; she had swept herself bare and scoured herself clean for him.
She was even a little afraid of it, of what it might come to mean.
And supposing it came to mean that she could get him do things?
Why, the bare idea of it was horrible.
Nothing could well have been more horrible to Agatha.
She could shut them all out, if it came to that, and make the whole place empty.
He was always, it seemed to her terror, on the verge.
Not that she had tried it on him first.
The narrow, flat farm-road linked the two.
Two villages, unseen, unheard, served her, not a mile away.
It was impossible to be more sheltered, more protected and more utterly cut off.
She looked at him and received her certainty.
It had gone, that little tragic droop in Agatha's face.
Yet as he looked at her he sighed again.
In fact, if it wasn't tempting Providence, I should say she was well.
It was another instance of the astounding and mysterious way it worked.
She must have got at Bella somehow in getting at him.
She saw now no end to the possibilities of the thing.
His next utterance came to her with no irrelevance.
He had never known anything about it, and it was not likely that he should know now.
Anybody, except Bella, was welcome to know that he came to see her.
She had always resented the imputation of secrecy in their relations.
It was always with him, a danger watching on his threshold.
He smiled as if he were satisfied, knowing her so well.
And still his thought, his terrible, naked thought, was there.
It was looking at her straight out of his eyes.
She doesn't know we know each other.
The beauty of it was that it would make them safe, absolutely safe.
She had only got to apply it to that thought of his, and the thought would not exist.
The door opened and a maid began to go in and out, laying the table for their meal.
It doesn't matter so much for me.
And you would be still, if these Powells hadn't found you out.
It isn't anything you'd think it was.
Her faculties of observation and of inference would be unimpaired.
It was proof against anything that anybody could think.
And the Powells were not given to thinking things.
Agatha's own mind had been a crystal without a flaw, in its clearness, its sincerity.
She had drawn her circle round Rodney and herself.
And yet the presence of the Powells had made a difference.
She was forced to own that it had made a difference in him.
She discovered in him a desire, an intention that up till now he had concealed from her.
It rose on terrifying wings and fluttered before her, troubling her.
She said to herself that they would take her mind off him.
It wasn't any longer, Milly Powell intimated, a question of borders and of thresholds.
Did Agatha know what he had been for years?
And besides, Agatha herself was an attraction.
It had occurred to Milly Powell that it might do Harding good to be near Agatha.
It was, Mrs. Powell said, as if she had some secret.
The darling couldn't hurt a fly; he could only hurt himself.
He would have, she said sadly, to go away somewhere.
That was why she wanted to be near her.
It was awful not to be near somebody who understood, who would understand him.
It appealed to her by its sheer audacity.
Agatha said that was the line she did take.
How can he get better if we keep him wrapped in it?
Don't you realize what it means to be so near?
Already she was drawing her charmed circle round him.
She said the terrible part of it was that they were left so much alone.
People were beginning to shrink from him, to be afraid of him.
Would Agatha go with her and see him?
The house was like a house of the dead.
When they had entered Agatha saw her turn it in the lock again, slowly and without a sound.
All the doors were shut in the passage, and it was dark there.
Milly opened a door on the left at the foot of the steep stairs.
It cast thin, turbid, brown shadows on the walls.
His eyes seemed to come up last of all from the depths to meet her.
With a peculiar foreign courtesy he bowed his head again over her hand as he held it.
He apologized for the darkness in which they found him.
The light revealed him in his exquisite perfection, his small fragile finish.
Above these eyes his brows were twisted, tortured with his terror.
He wondered whether they would object to his drawing.
Milly laid her hand on the arm that he stretched towards the window.
No place ever will be strange when It's there.
Of course if I'd slept last night I'd have known it wasn't there.
When the light went they lit a lamp.
Agatha stayed and dined with them, that being the best thing she could do.
At nine o'clock she rose and said good-night to Harding Powell.
The plan, she said, was no good after all.
With it, as long as it lasted, little Milly, plan as she would, was safe.
But they couldn't count on its lasting.
That was the maddest thing he had done yet.
She had shuddered at it as at an act of violence.
It emphasized the fact that they were flying, that they had to fly.
That had been in her mind when she had insisted on it that he would sleep.
She knew what Milly meant by her sigh and the look she gave her.
His case, his piteous case, cried out for an extension of the gift.
She hadn't any doubt as to its working.
There were things she didn't know about it yet, but she was sure of that.
She had proved it by a hundred experimental intermissions, abstentions, and recoveries.
In order to be sure you had only to let go and see how you got on without it.
She had tried in that way, with scepticism and precaution, on herself.
She could not say that she had tried it in the beginning at all, even on herself.
It had simply come to her, as she put it, by a divine accident.
Talk of the verge, the wonder was they hadn't gone clean over it, both of them.
It came one day, one night when she was at her worst.
She had not even stumbled on it, blundered up against it in the blackness.
She looked back at the farm-house with its veiled windows.
It was the fragile shell of a sacred and a burning light.
She crossed the river and went up the hill through the woods.
She walked there every evening in the darkness, calling her thoughts home to sleep.
It was the blessed state desired as the condition of the working of the gift.
She went still more gently and with half-shut eyes through her illuminated house.
She sank in it and was covered with wave upon wave of darkness.
She sank and was upheld; she dissolved and was gathered together again, a flawless crystal.
She drew Harding Powell into it and held him there.
In a moment the fleshly image receded, it sank back into the darkness.
His name, Harding Powell, was now the only earthly sign of him that she suffered to appear.
In the third moment his name was blotted out.
And as she slid into her own sleep she held and drew him with her.
Early the next morning she went over to the Farm.
The blinds were up; the doors and windows were flung open.
Milly met her at the garden gate.
She stopped her and walked a little way with her across the field.
I know, for I stayed awake and watched him.
Powell had come out and was in the garden, leaning on the gate.
He opened the gate for them, raising his hat and smiling as they came.
His face witnessed to the wonder worked on him.
The colour showed clean, purged of his taint.
His eyes were candid and pure under brows smoothed by sleep.
Milly drew in her breath with a little sound like a sob.
Her joy was so great that it was almost unbearable.
Then he looked at Agatha and admired the green gown she wore.
It was as easy as drawing your breath; it was indeed the breath you drew.
It was as if from night to night the times swung together and made one enduring timeless time.
For the process belonged to a region that was not of times or time.
She held him now by a single slender thread, and the thread was Bella.
That was the blessedness of her attitude to Harding Powell.
And never before had she been given so complete, so overwhelming a sense of having helped.
Not that that altogether accounted for it to Harding Powell.
They stood a moment up there and looked around them.
April was coming on, but the land at their feet was still bare; the earth waited.
Rain had fallen in the night, and the river had risen; it rested there, poised.
She was not dazzled by it or confused in any way.
Her senses were exalted, adjusted to the pitch.
Harding Powell denied, he always had denied, the supernatural.
And when she turned to him her vision had passed from her.
He wanted to see more of this wonderful place.
And then he spoke of his lenghty recovery.
You saw how I was the day after we came.
My sister's little girl is very ill.
She made up her mind to tell her that evening as they sat alone in Agatha's house.
And again she said it was the place, the wonderful place.
It was then that Agatha told her.
Milly came over to Agatha with the news.
She said it had been an awful shock, of course.
She'd been dreading something like that for him.
His behaviour was the crowning proof, if Milly wanted more proof, of his sanity.
He went up to London and made still the arrangements for his sister.
When he returned he forestalled Milly's consolations with the truth.
He took it as a sane man takes a terrible alternative.
He had grown accustomed to his own sanity and no longer marvelled at it.
And still, without intermission, Agatha went on.
Milly, familiarized with its working, had become a fanatical believer in the Power.
She might have worked havoc if, with her temperament, she had doubted.
And she was afraid lest the pull he had on her might weaken Rodney's thread.
And she had a further glimpse of the way the gift worked its wonders.
Three Fridays had passed, and he had not come.
Not that it was the intention that had failed her now.
It had succeeded so beautifully, so perfectly, that he had no need to come at all.
She had given Bella back to him.
She had given him back to Bella.
Only, she faced the full perfection of her work.
After all, Rodney had Bella; and she had nobody but Rodney.
He was the one solitary thing she cared for.
Now she longed, with an unendurable longing, for his visible presence.
There were ways below the threshold by which desire could get at him.
She refused to hold him even by a thread.
It was Bella, and Bella only that she held now.
He didn't know what was the matter with him.
He supposed it was the same old thing again.
He couldn't think how poor Bella stood him, but she did.
It must be awfully bad for her.
She began again from the beginning, from the first process of purification and surrender.
She was bound equally not to let Harding go.
Yes, there was no blinking it, he prevailed.
Not that she thought it really had connived.
That was unthinkable, and Agatha did not think these things; she felt them.
She only wanted to know, she said, that he was better, that he was well.
She begged him to write and tell her that he was well.
He prevailed to such good purpose that he was now, Milly said, well enough to go back to business.
Milly's face, as she said it, was all candour.
He did not write, but on the Friday of that week, the sixth week, he came.
He never knocked; he came straight and swiftly to her through the open doors.
He shut the door of the room behind him and held her by her arms with both his hands.
They had sat down on the couch in the corner so that they faced each other.
Agatha faced him, but fear was in her eyes.
He glanced at her under his bent brows.
She doesn't care a rap about me.
Milly and her husband were standing at the gate of the Farm.
Harding, indeed, was more perfect in his beautiful quality than ever.
She saw it in his eyes, his large, dark, wild animal eyes, chiefly.
She was not even sure, now, that they had recognized him.
She knew he wanted to talk to her.
Agatha proposed that they should walk up the hill through the wood.
She was bound to accept his statement.
He must have known that Milly had broken her word, and he was trying to shield her.
I don't know now, though Milly tried to tell me.
It was from that evening that she really dated it, the thing that came upon her.
She was aware that in staying she disobeyed an instinct that told her to go home.
The horrible light went when the flame of the lamp burnt clearer.
She was ill; she was tired; they must forgive her, but she must go.
She was walking fast, almost running, with a furtive step, as if something pursued her.
He turned from his wife and went slowly back into the house.
She knew now what had happened to her.
The awful thing was that she knew she could not get away from him.
She was tired, as if she had had some long and unrestrained communion with him.
She told herself that, after all, her fear had done no harm.
All the same, she felt that she could not go through another day like yesterday.
She hoped that Milly would forgive her if they didn't see her for the next day or two.
Milly wrote back that, of course, she understood.
How could she, when she saw what it had done to Harding?
And Agatha found herself resenting Milly's view.
The three nights passed as before, but with an increasing struggle and fear.
And her fear of him became pervading, nameless and shapeless too.
She waited for her hour between sunset and twilight.
It was perfect, following a perfect day.
She paused on the bridge, and looked down the valley.
She saw the farm-house standing in the stillness that was its own secret and the hour's.
A strange, pale lamplight, lit too soon, showed in the windows of the room she knew.
The Powells would be sitting there at their supper.
She went on and came to the gate of the wood.
Presently she saw Harding Powell coming down the wood-path.
It was her sanity, not his own, that he walked in.
What she saw was the empty shell of him.
Now her fear, which had become almost hatred, was transferred to his person.
In the flesh, as in the spirit, he was pursuing her.
As she turned the corner of the wood, she was brought suddenly in sight of the valley.
A hot wave swept over her brain, so strong that she staggered as it passed.
It was followed by a strange sensation of physical sickness, that passed also.
All this she perceived in a flash, when she had turned the corner.
A terrified bird flew out of the hedge, no further than a flight in front of her.
And in that place it flew from, she saw Harding Powell.
He held out his hand to steady her as she came on over the swinging plank.
Her gift, her secret, was powerless now against the pursuer.
She had a light burning in her room till morning, for she was afraid of sleep.
It was not her own madness that possessed her.
There could be no doubt as to what had happened, nor as to the way of its happening.
The danger of it, utterly unforeseen, was part of the very operation of the gift.
It seemed to her that to have a madness of your own would not be so very horrible.
If her doors stood open to him, they stood open to Bella and to Rodney too.
If he could get at her, of course he could get, through her at Rodney.
That was the Terror of terrors, and it was her own.
In her love for Rodney and her fear for him she entrenched herself against the destroyer.
She would have to break her word to Milly.
She had not counted on his clinging.
He hung on desperately; he refused to yield an inch of the ground he had taken from her.
He was no longer a passive thing in that world where she had brought him.
It took her three nights and three days to cast him out.
She could no longer trust her knowledge of its working, but she tried to come to terms with it.
Apparently, that was not the way it worked.
The odds between her and her adversary were even.
She felt that she had built up her walls again; that she had cut Harding off.
Possibly the Power was neutral; for in the dawn after the second night she slept.
That sleep left her uncertain of the event.
There was no telling into what unguarded depths it might have carried her.
There is no striving and no crying in the world which you would enter.
You cannot make your own terms with the high and holy Power.
It was the seal upon the bond.
She woke on Friday morning to a vivid and indestructible certainty of escape.
Friday was Rodney's day, and this time she knew that he would come.
His coming, of course, was nothing, but he had told her plainly that he would not go.
She must, therefore, wire to him not to come.
In order to do this she had to get up early and walk about a mile to the nearest village.
That was because Harding and Milly were gone.
She had done all that was possible.
And how could she have faced Milly after having broken her word to her?
Not that she regretted even that, the breaking of her word, so sane was she.
And as she searched now for the flaw, with her luminous sanity, she found it in her fear.
But for the rest, she had tried to make herself clear as crystal.
And what could she do more than give up Rodney?
Her maid was standing by the garden gate, looking for her.
As she approached, the girl came over the field to meet her.
She had an air of warning her, of preparing her for something.
She was in there, waiting for Miss Agatha.
She wouldn't go away; she had gone straight in.
The maid thought it was something to do with Mr. Powell.
Milly rose from the corner where she sat averted.
It was just three days since she began to let him go.
He's afraid of being seen, being found.
Agatha faced the window, so that the light ravaged her.
Her voice broke out again, clear, harsh, accusing.
You did it for one night, and that night he was well.
You kept on for six weeks, and he was well all that time.
How can you bear to let him suffer?
If it's divine, wouldn't it be compassionate?
That was what she must never tell her, not even to make her understand.
That would never have made you give Harding up.
You wouldn't have done that if there had not been something.
I only know that if I'd had a gift like that, I would not have given it up for anything.
I wouldn't have let anything come between.
I couldn't keep myself entirely for Harding; there were other things, other people.
